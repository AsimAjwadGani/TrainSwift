# **Challenges:**

I face many challenges while making this app but I’ll highlight some of the major ones which really helped me learn a lot. 

- The first challenge I faced was how to get started, I started with shortlisting my inspirations. I thoroughly checked the whole process of booking ticket in real life apps like trainline etc and extracted features that I wanted to implement.

- Making a nice and clean user interface was my most important priority. Therefore, I learned about Design principles that I need to implement in my project and keep in mind while building.

- When I started making this app, I want to implement a complete flow from start to end of booking a train ticket. I got to know that implementing it needs a complete backend which I don’t know, So I used local storage and saved everything locally instead of saving in a database. 

- I used React for the frontend as its one of the most used tool for completing these type of tasks and really helped me completing my tasks fast as compare to using Vanilla JS.

- Writing all the CSS manually was really challenging so I opted for Tailwind CSS which helped me styling fast and easily.

- While building the app I realized one things that there are some building blocks that we use in every page like buttons, cards, dialog, alerts etc. building them separately for each page was cumbersome so I opted for ShadcnUI which provided me with some built in components and helped me achieving my goals fast.

- All these challenges really helped me be a better developer and learn more about web development.
